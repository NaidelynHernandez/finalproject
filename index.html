<h2> Cancel Culture </h2>

   <h2> The act of promoting the “canceling” of people, brands and even shows and movies due to what some consider to be offensive or problematic remarks or ideologies
   </h2>

 <h2> Why do people partipate? </h2>

    <h2> "Some see participating in cancel culture as the most effective way to hold public figures to account, especially if no other lawful way appears to be working. By bringing the grievance public, it forces
      the accused’s employers and others to confront the situation and distance themselves from the perpetrator. In other words, it re-balances the power gap between those with huge audiences and the people or
       communities who could be negatively affected"
